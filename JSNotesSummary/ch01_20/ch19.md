## Chapter 19: Functions

We can take any snippet of code and wrap a function around it, and that effectively "hides" any enclosed variable or function declarations from the outside scope inside that function's inner scope.

To distinguish between a **function declaration** and a **function expression** is the position of the word `function` in the statement (**not just a line, but a distinct statement**). If "function" is the very first thing in the statement, then it's a function declaration. Otherwise, it's a function expression.

### Section 19.1: Function Scoping

The origin from where a function can be accessed is called the **function scope**.

When you define a function, it creates a scope.

Everything (variables/functions) defined within the function is not accessible by code outside the function.

The same rules applied in **nested functions**

<p class="code-link"><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/function-scope-example-1-q86ox">Function Scope - Example 1</a></p>

```javascript
function foo() {
  var a = "hello";
  function bar() {
    var b = "world";
    console.log(a); // => 'hello'
    console.log(b); // => 'world'
  }
  console.log(a); // => 'hello'
  console.log(b); // reference error
}
console.log(a); // reference error
console.log(b); // reference error
```

A function defined inside another function can also access all variables defined in it's parent function and any other variable to which the parent function can access.

<p class="code-link"><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/function-scope-example-1-490ps?file=/index.js">Function Scope - Example 2</a></p>

```js
// The following variables are defined in the global scope
var x = 12,
  y = 25;

// This function is defined in the global scope
function add() {
  console.log(x + y); //12,25
}
add();

function outerScope() {
  // 'a' and 'b' variables have a local function scope
  var a = 1,
    b = 2;

  // this a local - chianed - function and can
  //access outer function scope and global scope
  //(outer of the outer)
  function innerScope() {
    console.log(a, b, x, y); //
  }
  innerScope();
} //end of outerScope() function
outerScope(); // 1 2 12 25
```

### Section 19.3: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

Sometimes you don't want to have your function accessible/stored as a variable. You can create an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE for short).

These are essentially self-executing anonymous functions. They have
access to the surrounding scope, but the function itself and any internal variables will be inaccessible from outside.

An important thing to note about IIFE is that even if you name your function, **IIFE are not hoisted** like standard functions are and **cannot be called by the function name they are declared with**.

```js
(function () {
  alert(
    "I've run - but can't be run again because I'm immediately invoked at runtime, leaving behind only the result I generate"
  );
})();
```

This is another way to write IIFE. Notice that the closing parenthesis before the semicolon was moved and placed right after the closing curly bracket:

```js
(function () {
  alert("This is IIFE too.");
})();
```

You can easily pass parameters into an IIFE:

```js
(function(message) {
alert(message);
}("Hello World!"));
Additionally, you can return values to the surrounding scope:
var example = (function() {
return 42;
}());
console.log(example); // => 42
```

---

### Section 19.4: Named Functions

Functions can either be named or unnamed (anonymous functions):

```js
var namedSum = function sum(a, b) {
  // named
  return a + b;
};
var anonSum = function (a, b) {
  // anonymous
  return a + b;
};
namedSum(1, 3); // 4
anonSum(1, 3); // 4
```

But their names are private to their own scope:

```js
var sumTwoNumbers = function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
sum(1, 3); //Uncaught ReferenceError: sum is not defined
```

<mark>Named functions differ from the anonymous functions in multiple scenarios:</mark>

**When you are debugging, the name of the function will appear in the error/stack trace**

**Named functions are hoisted while anonymous functions are not:**

When using an anonymous function, the function can only be called after the line of declaration, whereas a named function can be called before declaration. Consider

```js
foo();
var foo = function () {
  // using an anonymous function
  console.log("bar"); //Uncaught TypeError: foo is not a function
};
foo();
function foo() {
  // using a named function
  console.log("bar"); //bar
}
```

- **Named functions and anonymous functions behave differently when handling recursion:**

```js
//A recursive function can be defined as:
var say = function (times) {
if (times > 0) {
console.log('Hello!');
}
}
say(times - 1);

//you could call 'say' directly,
//but this way just illustrates the example

var sayHelloTimes = say;
sayHelloTimes(2);
  //Hello!
  //Hello!

//What if somewhere in your code the original function binding gets redefined?

var say = function (times) {
if (times > 0) {
console.log('Hello!');
}
}
say(times - 1);
var sayHelloTimes = say;
say = "oops";
sayHelloTimes(2);
  //Hello!
  //Uncaught TypeError: say is not a function

//This can be solved using a named function
// The outer variable can even have the same name as the function
// as they are contained in different scopes

var say = function say (times) {
if (times > 0) {
console.log('Hello!');
}
}

// this time, 'say' doesn't use the outer variable
// it uses the named function

say(times - 1);
var sayHelloTimes = say;
say = "oops";
sayHelloTimes(2);
  //Hello!
  //Hello!
```

And as bonus, the named function can't be set to undefined, even from inside:

```javascript
var say = function say (times) {
// this does nothing
say = undefined;
if (times > 0) {
console.log('Hello!');
}
}
// this time, 'say' doesn't use the outer variable
// it's using the named function
say(times - 1);
var sayHelloTimes = say;
say = "oops";
sayHelloTimes(2);
  //Hello!
  //Hello!
```


- **Depending on ECMAScript version, named and anonymous functions may treat the function name property
differently**

### Section 19.7: Anonymous Function

### Section 19.8: Default parameters

**Parameters:**

- Also called 'arguments'
- a function always get a **copy** (not reference like Javascript 'Objects').
- if a parameter is not provided, then it will take the 'default value' else 'undefined'

### Section 19.11: Passing arguments by reference or value

Two types of parameters which are passed to the function:

1. **primitive** data type parameters - JS predefined types of data such as integer,string...
2. **nonprimitive** data type parameters - User created data types, called (reference variables/object references). It reference a memory location where the data stored - such as user-defined objects,arrays.

<p class="code-link"><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/js-parameters-primative-vs-non-primative-example-1-j5j59?file=/index.js">JS Parameters - primative vs non-primative - Example 1</a></p>

```js
// JS Parameters - primative vs non-primative - Example 1:

//If you pass an object as a nonprimitive parameter and
// the function changes the object's properties then,
// changes is reflected globally:

function student(theObject) {
  theObject.name = "Sara";
}

var student1 = { name: "Scott", standard: "V", roll_no: 1 };
var x, y;
x = student1.name; // x gets the value "Scott"
student(student1);
y = student1.name; // y gets the value "Sara"
// (the name property was changed by the function)
````

```js
// JS Parameters - primative vs non-primative - Example 2:

//If you assign a new object to the parameter, there will
// be no effect outside the function, because this is
// changing the value of the parameter rather than the
// value of individual object's properties, instead it
// created a new local variable and have the same name
// as the global object passed in.

function student(theObject) {
  theObject = { name: "Sara", standard: "VI", roll_no: 1 };
}

var student1 = { name: "Scott", standard: "V", roll_no: 1 };
var x, y;

x = student1.name; // x gets the value "Scott"
student(student1);
y = student1.name; // y still gets the value "Scott"
```

#### Style Guide: Function parameters - (from w3resources)

**For code examples**
[https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/functions/javascript-function.php#SCOPEFUN]

- Never name a parameter arguments. This will take precedence over the arguments object that is given to every function scope.
- Always put the default parameters last
- Never use the Function constructor to create a new function. Creating a function in this way evaluates a string similarly to `eval()`
- make Spacing in a function signature
