> Summary of Scope:

   - Every JS runtime has a global scope
     - Identical with the global object
     - Window in browsers, global in node, self in a worker...
   - Local variables are declared with "var" and are scoped to the function the are declared wihtin
   - Function declarations (not expression) produce local bindings, and have priority over "var" in the same scope
   - When a variable is accessed (declared or not), JS resolves it by looking int the current scope for a variable with that name.
     - If it fails to find one, it looks through the eclosing scopoes in order from the innermost to the global.
     - As soon as it finds a variable with that name it **stops** and uses that one.
       - If does not find any variable by the end, it produces a `ReferenceError` (for reads) or "accidentally" (implicity) creates a global variable (for writers).
       - As a consequence, if an outer scope variable is "shadowed": by a closer (inner) variable of the same name, the outer will not be accessible by scope resoulution

A closure is a pairing of:

- A function, and
- A reference to that function's outer scope (lexical environment)

A `lexical environment` is part of every **execution context** (stack frame) and is a map between identifiers (ie. local variable names) and values.

**Every function in JavaScript maintains a reference to its outer lexical environment.** This reference is used to configure the execution context created when a function is invoked. _This reference enables code inside the function to "see" variables declared outside the function, **regardless** of when and where the function is called._

```javascript
var x = 4; // declaration in outer scope
function bar() {
  console.log(x); // outer scope is captured on declaration
}
bar(); // prints 4 to console
```

<p calss="code-link"><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/function-outer-scope-wjcuw">codesandbox.io</a></p>

Using this concept of "capturing" scope, we can use and modify variables from an outer scope even after the outer scope **exits**. For example, consider the following:

```javascript
function foo() {
  var x = 4; // declaration in outer scope
  function bar() {
    console.log(x); // outer scope is captured on declaration
  }
  return bar;
}
// x goes out of scope after foo returns
var barWithX = foo();
//The function foo, whose context is captured in another function, is said to be a closure.
barWithX(); // we can still access x - output 4
```

<p calss="code-link"><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/capturing-scope-concept-2djrd?file=/index.js:368-645">codesandbox.io</a></p>

If a function was called by a function, which in turn was called by another function, then a **chain of references** to outer lexical environments is created. This chain is called the `scope chain`.

```javascript
//In the following code, inner forms a closure with the
// lexical environment of the execution context created
// when foo is invoked, closing over variable secret:

function foo() {
  const secret = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 100);
  return function inner() {
    console.log(`The secret number is ${secret}.`);
  };
}
const f = foo(); // `secret` is not directly accessible from outside `foo`
f(); // The only way to retrieve `secret`, is to invoke `f`
```

#### Uses of Closures

- **Private data**: When you need a private state/data associated with a function. **Private data**, mean's defining "private" variables that are visible only to a specific function or set of functions.

```javascript
// Example 1:
function makeCounter() {
  var counter = 0;
  return {
    value: function () {
      return counter;
    },
    increment: function () {
      counter++;
    },
  };
} //end of makeCounter()
var a = makeCounter(); //when called, a snapshot of the context of that function is created/saved
var b = makeCounter(); //another different context snapshot created
a.increment();
console.log(a.value());
console.log(b.value());
```

```javascript
// Example 2: the function toString closes over the details of the car.

function Car(manufacturer, model, year, color) {
  return {
    toString() {
      return `${manufacturer} ${model} (${year}, ${color})`;
    },
  };
}
const car = new Car("Aston Martin", "V8 Vantage", "2012", "Quantum Silver");
console.log(car.toString());
```

- **Functional Programming**


```javascript
// Functional Prpgraming example:

//In the following code, the function inner closes over both fn and args.
function curry(fn) {
  const args = [];
  return function inner(arg) {
    if (args.length === fn.length) return fn(...args);
    args.push(arg);
    return inner;
  };
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const curriedAdd = curry(add);
console.log(curriedAdd(2)(3)()); // 5
```

- **Event-Oriented Programming**

```javascript
//In the following code, function onClick closes
// over variable BACKGROUND_COLOR.

const $ = document.querySelector.bind(document)
const BACKGROUND_COLOR = 'rgba(200,200,242,1)'

function onClick() {
  $('body').style.background = BACKGROUND_COLOR
}

$('button').addEventListener('click', onClick)

<button>Set background color</button>
```

- **Modularization**

`Closures` have enabled us to modularise and encapsulate our code.

```javascript
// In the following example, all the
//implementation details are hidden inside an 
//immediately executed function expression.

//The functions tick and toString close over
// the private state and functions they need to
// complete their work.

let namespace = {};

(function foo(n) {
  let numbers = [];
  function format(n) {
    return Math.trunc(n);
  }
  function tick() {
    numbers.push(Math.random() * 100);
  }
  function toString() {
    return numbers.map(format);
  }
  n.counter = {
    tick,
    toString,
  };
})(namespace);

const counter = namespace.counter;
counter.tick();
counter.tick();
console.log(counter.toString());
```

#### Examples of Closures

**Example 1**: This example shows that the local variables are not copied in the closure: the closure maintains a reference to the original variables themselves. It is as though the stack-frame stays alive in memory even after the outer function exits.

```javascript
function foo() {
  let x = 42;
  let inner = function () {
    console.log(x);
  };
  x = x + 1;
  return inner;
}
var f = foo();
f(); // logs 43
```

**Example 2:** In the following code, three methods log, increment, and update all close over the same lexical environment. And every time createObject is called, a new execution context (stack frame) is created and a completely new variable x, and a new set of functions (log etc.) are created, that close over this new variable.

```javascript
function createObject() {
  let x = 42;
  return {
    log() {
      console.log(x);
    },
    increment() {
      x++;
    },
    update(value) {
      x = value;
    },
  };
}

const o = createObject();
o.increment();
o.log(); // 43
o.update(5);
o.log(); // 5
const p = createObject();
p.log(); // 42
```

**Example 3:** If you are using variables declared using var, be careful you understand which variable you are closing over. Variables declared using var are hoisted. This is much less of a problem in modern JavaScript due to the introduction of let and const.

In the following code, each time around the loop, a new function inner is created, which closes over i. But because var i is hoisted outside the loop, all of these inner functions close over the same variable, meaning that the final value of i (3) is printed, three times.

```javascript
function foo() {
  var result = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    result.push(function inner() {
      console.log(i);
    });
  }
  return result;
}

const result = foo();
// The following will print `3`, three times...
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  result[i]();
}
```

#### Final points:

- Whenever a function is declared in JavaScript closure is created.
- Returning a function from inside another function is the classic example of closure, because the state inside the outer function is implicitly available to the returned inner function, even after the outer function has completed execution.
- Whenever you use eval() inside a function, a closure is used. The text you eval can reference local variables of the function, and in the non-strict mode, you can even create new local variables by using eval('var foo = …').
- When you use new Function(…) (the Function constructor) inside a function, it does not close over its lexical environment: it closes over the global context instead. The new function cannot reference the local variables of the outer function.
- A closure in JavaScript is like keeping a reference (NOT a copy) to the scope at the point of function declaration, which in turn keeps a reference to its outer scope, and so on, all the way to the global object at the top of the scope chain.
- A closure is created when a function is declared; this closure is used to configure the execution context when the function is invoked.
- A new set of local variables is created every time a function is called.

### Section 56.2: Hoisting

**Hoisting** is a mechanism which moves all variable and function declarations to the top of their scope. However, variable assignments still happen where they originally were.

```javascript
console.log(foo); // → undefined
var foo = 42;
console.log(foo); // → 42

// The above code is the same as:

var foo; // → Hoisted variable declaration
console.log(foo); // → undefined
foo = 42; // → variable assignment remains in the same place
console.log(foo); // → 42
```

A similar principle applies to functions. When functions are assigned to a variable (i.e. a function expression), the variable declaration is hoisted while the assignment remains in the same place. The following two code snippets are equivalent.

```javascript
console.log(foo(2, 3)); // → foo is not a function
var foo = function (a, b) {
  return a * b;
};
var foo;
console.log(foo(2, 3)); // → foo is not a function
foo = function (a, b) {
  return a * b;
};
```

When declaring function statements, a different scenario occurs. Unlike function statements, function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope.

Consider the following code:

```javascript
console.log(foo(2, 3)); // → 6
function foo(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
//The above code is the same as the next code snippet due
// to hoisting:
function foo(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
console.log(foo(2, 3)); // → 6
```

<p class="code-link"><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/hoisting-1-4cp6r?file=/index.js">Hoisting-1</a></p>

#### Examples of What is/isn't hoisting

```javascript
// Valid code:
foo();
function foo() {}

// Invalid code:
bar(); // → TypeError: bar is not a function

var bar = function () {};
// Valid code:
foo();
function foo() {
bar();
}
function bar() {}
// Invalid code:
foo();
function foo() {
bar(); // → TypeError: bar is not a function
}
var bar = function () {};
// (E) valid:
function foo() {
bar();
}
var bar = function(){};
foo();
```

#### Limitations of Hoisting

Initializing a variable can not be Hoisted

for example, this will log '6'
```js
var x = 2;
var y = 4;
console.log(x + y);
```
But this...

```javascript
var x=2;
console.log(x+y); // NaN
var y=4; //initializing the value of 'y', so Hoisting will not happening
```
#### Summay of Hoisting:

- **Hoisting**: before a function is executed, its body is parser/scanned for declarations (i.e., `var` & `function declaration`)

  – Resulting local allocations are created in a local scope object before any code in the function body is run.
    - `var` declarations create a local scope variable but with not assign a value.
    - Function declarations create a local variable and a function object and bind the variable to the function (value) hoisting time.

- **Hoisting** disregards program flow logic; logically unreachable declarations can still be “hoisted” and affect your program!

- **Notes:**
  – Redeclarations of the same name in same scope are no-ops.
  – We are ignoring the complication of the deprecated “with” feature.
  – ES6 allows block scoped variables with new “let” keyword
  – Function declarations in a block have varied treatment in browsers (e.g., as of June
2014,Chrome/Firefox treat them differently! Recommend avoiding...)
