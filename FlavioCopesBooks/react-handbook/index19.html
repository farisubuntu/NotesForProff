        <div class="section">
            <p class="calibre8">Unidirectional Data Flow is not a concept unique to React, but as a JavaScript developer this might be the first time you hear it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In general this concept means that data has one, and only one, way to be transferred to other parts of the application.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In React this means that:</p>
<ul class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre16">state is passed to the view and to child components</li>
<li class="calibre16">actions are triggered by the view</li>
<li class="calibre16">actions can update the state</li>
<li class="calibre16">the state change is passed to the view and to child components</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre8"><img src="view-actions-state.png" alt="View-actions-state" class="calibre9"/></p>
<p class="calibre8">The view is a result of the application state. State can only change when actions happen. When actions happen, the state is updated.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thanks to one-way bindings, data cannot flow in the opposite way (as would happen with two-way bindings, for example), and this has some key advantages:</p>
<ul class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre16">it's less error prone, as you have more control over your data</li>
<li class="calibre16">it's easier to debug, as you know <em class="calibre17">what</em> is coming from <em class="calibre17">where</em></li>
<li class="calibre16">it's more efficient, as the library already knows what the boundaries are of each part of the system</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre8">A state is always owned by one Component. Any data that's affected by this state can only affect Components below it: its children.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Changing state on a Component will never affect its parent, or its siblings, or any other Component in the application: just its children.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This is the reason that the state is often moved up in the Component tree, so that it can be shared between components that need to access it.</p>
